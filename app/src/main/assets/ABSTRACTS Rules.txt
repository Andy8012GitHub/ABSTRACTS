Thanks for downloading the ABSTRACTS app!

ABSTRACTS is a party game.  It is designed to be played with two teams.
Collect all three tokens – the PERSON (da Vinci’s “Man”), the PLACE (“World”), and the THING (“All-seeing Eye”) – by correctly guessing each from clues given by Clue Givers, and your team wins!
Players tap “Play,” and select PEOPLE, PLACES, & THINGs to use or purchase from Google Play.
BEGINNING THE GAME
Two teams with two or more players each (we’ve tested it with forty people) sit apart to discreetly discuss possible answers. Both teams are trying to guess the same PERSON, PLACE, or THING (PPT), so listen carefully to all clues as they will often build upon each other.
Clue Givers share one device even though they change during the game. Team members may also download the ABSTRACTS app to review rules, remind the team of definitions of PEOPLE, PLACES & THINGS, and to keep score.
If players choose to enter their team names and members, Clue Givers will be chosen randomly by the game.
When one of the Clue Givers pushes the “PPT Start” button, a choice of a PERSON, PLACE, or THING will appear on the device. The first team’s Clue Giver picks one of the PPTs. That Clue Giver announces which category the Clue Givers are giving clues for (PERSON, PLACE, or THING). The other Clue Giver then decides if he/she wants to give clues first or second.
Whoever gives a clue first presses “Get New Clue,” and either uses the clue (or one of the three clues in the case of a Wild Card) or presses the button again. As soon as the Clue Giver selects an option and gives the clue, his or her team has 60 seconds to come up with a guess of the famous PERSON, PLACE, or THING.
NOTE: If the Clue Givers are unfamiliar with the PERSON, PLACE, or THING, they can press the “New PPT” button, or they may use the Internet to get information. This is a battle of wits and wisdom, but it’s also just a game – so have fun, and make up whatever “house” rules work for your group.
THREE THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN GIVING CLUES
1.       You CANNOT give any part of the name of the PERSON, PLACE, or THING in your clue.
2.       You can only use up to five words in your clue (you have up to five words after saying “If I were a ______, I would be . . .”).
3.       Clues must be based on the clue you chose. You can be creative with your clues, use voice inflections, almost say a word and then say “blank,” etc.

NOTE: The violation of any of these rules results in the other Clue Giver or a score keeper pressing the “WEENIE Sound” button and calling the offending Clue Giver a “WEENIE.” The WEENIE’s team forfeits their guess, and play passes to the other team.
FOUR THINGS TO REMEMBER IN MAKING GUESSES
1.       Only the team whose turn it is can guess. If the other team guesses out of turn, the team whose turn it is may use that as their answer.
2.       Only one guess is allowed per clue. If someone blurts out a guess without discussing it with the rest of the team that becomes the one guess.
3.       Your team has 60 seconds from the time your Clue Giver finishes giving a clue until a guess is made. When time is up, a guess needs to be made or it’s the other team’s turn.
4.       All the PEOPLE, PLACES, and THINGS are proper nouns. There are no generic people like “teacher,” “firefighter,” “politician,” or generic places or things. PEOPLE are specific, real or fictional, single or small groups. EXAMPLES: “THE BEATLES” would be a person, as would “Taylor Swift,” and even “Bugs Bunny.” PLACES are tangible, historical or sometimes fictional locations. They often are cities, countries, monuments or tourist attractions. EXAMPLES: “The White House,” “Eiffel Tower,” and “Disneyland” would be PLACES and not THINGS. THINGS are hardest to wrap your head around because they are a weird catch-all category. They are often products, companies, organizations, titles of books, movies, TV shows, songs, etc. EXAMPLES: “Kentucky Fried Chicken,” “The Voice,” and “Google.”

EARNING TOKENS
If a team doesn’t guess exactly what is on the Clue Giver screen, both Clue Givers confer and decide if the answer is acceptable OR the Clue Giver says, “Partially correct,” and the team then has ONE more guess before play passes to the other team. EXAMPLE: If the PLACE was “CALGARY STAMPEDE” and the team guessed “CALGARY,” that is partially correct. However, if the THING was “GOOD MORNING AMERICA” and the team guessed “GOOD MORNING VIETNAM,” those are clearly two different THINGS, so play would pass to the other team.

When a team guesses correctly, the Clue Giver presses the “Got It” button and the token for that respective category will appear on-screen. A new Clue Giver, chosen from that team, presses the “New PPT” button and chooses a new PERSON, PLACE, or THING for both teams to guess. The other team’s Clue Giver gets to choose who goes first.
If a team’s guess is incorrect, they can quietly discuss, but should pay attention to the other team’s clues and guesses. Clue Givers must remain silent and neutral, including non-verbal expressions, when they are not giving clues. Clue Givers have the option of telling their team on a scale from one to twenty how close they were with their guess (determine by your “house rules”).

WINNING THE GAME
When one team has acquired all three tokens, the game is over.
NOTE:  Most games only last fifteen to twenty minutes. Play the best two out of three if you want to play longer.
